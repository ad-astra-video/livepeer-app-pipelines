# Batch Processing Examples

This folder contains two example applications demonstrating how to build custom container pipelines for batch processing using Livepeer's BYOC infrastructure. Both examples showcase different AI capabilities while sharing the same underlying architecture.

See readme in each folder for specific instructions to run the example.

## Examples

### 1. Create a Tall Tale (Text Generation)

- Showcases streaming SSE output of batch workloads using Livepeer BYOC integration

### 2. Image Generation

- Showcases speed of requests with a fast image gen model returning results in milliseconds
